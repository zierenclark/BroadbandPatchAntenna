# BroadbandPatchAntenna

Welcome to the repository for my Broadband Patch Antenna Design project! This project involved designing, simulating, fabricating, and analyzing a broadband patch antenna that operates at 2 GHz. The goal was to create an antenna with optimized gain and bandwidth while applying advanced concepts from electromagnetics.

Design and Simulation
The design process started with modeling the antenna using HFSS (High-Frequency Structure Simulator). This step involved calculating the physical dimensions of the patch and ground plane based on the operating frequency and the properties of the FR4 substrate. Key parameters, such as the feed location for impedance matching and the dimensions for maximum bandwidth, were optimized in the simulation. Using HFSS, I analyzed the antennaâ€™s performance, focusing on metrics like gain, bandwidth, and the S11 parameter, which evaluates how well the antenna is matched to its input.
